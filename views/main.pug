    h1 Google Foobar
    br
    p Google’s Foobar challenge is a secret recruitment challenge from Google that tests a chosen engineer’s knowledge in various computing and mathematical concepts such as various binary tree search algorithms, number theory, graph theory, dynamic programming, etc. I was chosen to participate in Google’s Foobar challenge when I was doing research for a project at work. The challenge started out easy, testing problems such as comparing two arrays to find the outlying elements and the search algorithm breadth-first search, and eventually getting harder, testing skills in concepts such as Markov Chains, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, and finding the maximum matchings of vertices in a given graph. This was a very fun challenge and I learned a lot from it.
